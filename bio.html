		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hello my name is Giovanni Lazala and I am a sophmore and I am also a cybersecurity major. I currently am an RA at SUNY Albany and enjoy helping my residents with anything I can.<br> I also ski, snowboard, and skateboard. I am currently trying to get insurcance on my car so I can get a second job other than being an RA. I want to join ski club and skate club but I am <br> going to wait till I can save money and get better grades. I also want to apply to be a housing manager but I also am waiting for better grades till I apply. The last two things I want to <br> mention about myself is that I love talking to new people and I also love to play almost any videogame.</p>
